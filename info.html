        <h1>Info/FAQ</h1>
            <h2>How do I use the bin loader payloads?</h2>
            <ul>
                You need to self-host to use this function, because it requires accessing the page with http protocol (GitHub forces https).<br>
                If you don't have the option to self-host, use <a href="https://github.com/Al-Azif/ps4-payload-guest">Payload Guest</a>.
            </ul>
			<h2>Should I update to firmware X?</h2>
			<ul>
				9.00 has a higher success rate, but requires connecting a specially-formatted USB drive to trigger the exploit.<br>
				If you're okay with this and have a spare flash drive, update to 9.00.
				<br><br>
				Firmwares higher than 9.00 cannot be exploited.
			</ul>
			<h2>Do I really need to restart after each failure?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>If you get an "out of memory" error, click OK. This error will not harm your console.</li>
					<li>If you get "failed to set up a relative ___ primitive" restart.</li>
					<li>If you get "failed to find slave" turn the console off using the power button, without closing the dialog box.<br>
					<li>If you keep getting OOM, back out of the browser and open the settings menu, then go back to the browser.<br>
					-This causes the webkit process to restart. Alternatively, power off completely and try again.</li>
					<li>Powering off completely seems work better for me than restarting. This is based purely on my experience, your mileage may vary.</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>Whats X in the debug settings?</h2>
				<ul>
					If you don't know what something does, you don't need it and shouldn't touch it.<br>
				</ul>
			<h2>How can I make the browser open on this page?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Use Al Azif's DNS: 165.227.83.145 and 192.241.221.79 (you really should use this all the time because it blocks PSN)</li>
					<li>This makes the browser homepage and user guide redirect to Al Azif's exploit host</li>
					<li>Press L2 and enter <code>https://lesking72.github.io/ps4/redirect.js</code> in the "Custom JS URL" field</li>
					<li>Click submit, then refresh the page</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Miscellaneous Tips</h2>
				<ul>
                    <li>Additional VRAM options for Linux are available <a href="https://github.com/Nazky/PS4Linux-Payloads">here</a>.
					<li>Custom fan thresholds persist until the power is disconnected; even across cold boots.</li>
					<li>The dummy folders created by Disable Updates may get deleted after kernel panics.</li>
                    <li>GoldHEN automatically creates these dummy folders.</li>
					<li>The self-host zip is <a class=btn href="https://github.com/Lesking72/ps4/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">here</a>.</li>

            <h2>HB Store locks up my console!</h2>
            <ul>
                This is a known issue when loading payloads through Mira Loader. I tried using an alternate method to launch<br>
                payloads, but it caused more obvious issues. If you want to use the HB Store,<br>
                load GoldHEN with the bin loader or download packages from pkg-zone.com and install them manually.
            </ul>
			<h2>Should I update to firmware X?</h2>
			<ul>
				9.00 has a higher success rate, but requires connecting a specially-formatted USB drive to trigger the exploit.<br>
				If you're okay with this and have a spare flash drive, update to 9.00.
				<br><br>
				Firmwares higher than 9.00 cannot be exploited.
			</ul>
			<h2>Do I really need to restart after each failure?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>If you get an "out of memory" error, click OK. This error will not harm your console.</li>
					<li>If you get any other error, restart.</li>
					<li>If you get "failed to find slave" enjoy your kernel panic.<br>
					<li>If you keep getting OOM, back out of the browser and open the settings menu, then go back to the browser.<br>
					-This causes the webkit process to restart. Alternatively, power off completely and try again.</li>
					<li>Powering off completely seems work better for me than restarting. This is based purely on my experience, your mileage may vary.</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>Whats X in the debug settings?</h2>
				<ul>
					If you don't know what something does, you don't need it and shouldn't touch it.<br>
                    In fact, stay out of the debug settings. Everything you need (the package installer) is in GoldHEN settings.
				</ul>
			<h2>How can I make the browser open on this page?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Use Al Azif's DNS: 165.227.83.145 and 192.241.221.79 (you really should use this all the time because it blocks PSN)</li>
					<li>This makes the browser homepage and user guide redirect to Al Azif's exploit host</li>
					<li>Press L2 and enter <code>https://lesking72.github.io/ps4/redirect.js</code> in the "Custom JS URL" field</li>
					<li>Click submit, then refresh the page</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>I have other questions/comments/hate mail</h2>
				<ul>
					Send it to Les#5465.
				</ul>
			<h2>Miscellaneous Tips</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Custom fan thresholds persist until the power is disconnected; even across cold boots.</li>
					<li>The dummy folders created by Disable Updates may get deleted after kernel panics.</li>
                    <li>GoldHEN creates the aforementioned folders when it starts.</li>
					<li>The self-host zip is <a class=btn href="https://github.com/Lesking72/ps4/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">here</a>.</li>
				</ul>
